            <p class="details1">To analyze the time domain response of the second order system.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="details1">The control system's time response is subdivided into two categories: transient and steady state. The term "response analysis" refers to examining at how output changes over time. The system's output requires a finite amount of time to attain its final value. The tendency of any system to resist the oscillatory behaviour of the system is known as damping. The damping of a system is quantified by a factor known as the damping ratio. There will be no oscillations in the output if the damping is very high. The result is totally exponential in nature for an over damped system. The system is considered a critically damped system if the damping is smaller than in an over damped scenario. Hence the response of a control system provides a detailed description of how the system operates in both transient and steady states. As a result, a time analysis of both phases is necessary. There are certain time parameters that can be used to assess the transient response, such as Delay Time, Rise Time, Peak Time, Settling Time, Maximum Overshoot, and so on.</p>
